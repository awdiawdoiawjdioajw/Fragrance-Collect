## üîç **Verification Steps**

### **Step 1: Check DNS Propagation**
1. Go to [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net)
2. Enter `fragrancecollect.com` in the search box
3. Click **"Search"**
4. Check if the DNS records are propagating worldwide

### **Step 2: Test Your Domain**
1. Wait 15-30 minutes after adding DNS records
2. Test: `https://fragrancecollect.com`
3. Test: `https://www.fragrancecollect.com`
4. Both should redirect to your GitHub Pages site

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Timeline**

- **DNS record addition**: 5-10 minutes
- **Initial propagation**: 15-30 minutes
- **Full propagation**: 24-48 hours (usually much faster)
- **HTTPS activation**: Up to 24 hours

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

#### **Domain Not Working After 30 Minutes**
1. **Double-check DNS records** - Make sure all 5 records are added correctly
2. **Check for typos** - Verify `awdiawdoiawjdioajw.github.io` is spelled correctly
3. **Clear browser cache** - Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. **Check propagation** - Use [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net)

#### **www Not Working**
- Make sure the CNAME record for `www` is added correctly
- The value should be: `awdiawdoiawjdioajw.github.io`

#### **HTTPS Not Working**
- GitHub Pages automatically provides SSL certificates
- May take up to 24 hours to activate
- Make sure "Enforce HTTPS" is checked in GitHub repository settings

### **Namecheap-Specific Issues:**

#### **"Host Records" Section Not Visible**
1. Make sure you're in the **"Advanced DNS"** tab
2. Scroll down to find the **"Host Records"** section
3. If using **"Basic DNS"**, switch to **"Advanced DNS"**

#### **Can't Add Records**
1. Make sure you're logged in with the correct account
2. Verify you own the `fragrancecollect.com` domain
3. Contact Namecheap support if issues persist
