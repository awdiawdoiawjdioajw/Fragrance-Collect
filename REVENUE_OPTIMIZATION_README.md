# 🚀 Revenue Optimization Implementation

## Overview
This implementation transforms your fragrance collection website into a revenue-maximizing machine by integrating both CJ (Commission Junction) and TikTok Shop, with intelligent product sorting, smart caching, and commission optimization.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛍️ Multi-Store Integration
- **CJ Store (Primary)**: Higher commission rates, proven track record
- **TikTok Shop (Secondary)**: Trending products, younger demographics
- **Smart Fallback**: Automatically switches to TikTok if CJ has no results

### 💰 Revenue Optimization
- **Commission-Based Sorting**: Shows highest-earning products first
- **Brand Category Weighting**: Luxury/Designer products get priority
- **Price Range Optimization**: Focuses on $50-$300 range (optimal commissions)
- **Trending Score**: Viral and trending products get boost

### ⚡ Performance Features
- **Smart Caching**: Dynamic cache duration based on search type
- **Parallel API Calls**: Simultaneous searches across both stores
- **Infinite Scroll**: Better user engagement, more product views

### 🎯 Search Intelligence
- **Revenue Scoring**: Combines commission, price, relevance, and trending
- **Smart Deduplication**: Removes duplicate products across stores
- **Advanced Filtering**: Price, brand, rating, and store filters

## 📊 Revenue Metrics

### Commission Rates by Category
| Category | Rate | Weight |
|----------|------|--------|
| Luxury | 12% | 1.0x |
| Designer | 10% | 0.9x |
| Niche | 8% | 0.8x |
| Celebrity | 9% | 0.85x |
| Seasonal | 7% | 0.75x |
| Default | 6% | 0.7x |

### Revenue Scoring Formula
```
Revenue Score = (Commission Rate × 100) + Price Bonus + Relevance Bonus
Final Score = Revenue Score × Brand Weight × Store Weight
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```toml
# wrangler.toml
CJ_WEBSITE_ID = "101510315"
CJ_COMPANY_ID = "7673871"
CJ_DEV_KEY = "your-dev-key" # In .dev.vars
```

### Revenue Constants
```javascript
const REVENUE_CONFIG = {
  TIKTOK_PARTNER_ID: '7563286',
  CJ_WEIGHT: 0.7,        // CJ products get 70% weight
  TIKTOK_WEIGHT: 0.3,    // TikTok products get 30% weight
  OPTIMAL_PRICE_RANGE: { min: 50, max: 300 }
};
```

## 📱 API Usage

### Basic Search
```bash
GET /products?q=perfume&limit=100&sortBy=revenue
```

### Advanced Search
```bash
GET /products?q=luxury&lowPrice=100&highPrice=500&brand=designer&includeTikTok=true&sortBy=commission
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "products": [...],
  "total": 150,
  "revenue": {
    "totalProducts": 150,
    "totalValue": "22500.00",
    "averageCommission": "0.085",
    "estimatedTotalCommission": "1912.50"
  },
  "sources": {
    "cj": 105,

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scripts
```javascript
// Test all features
window.testRevenueOptimization.runAllTests()

// Test individual components
window.testRevenueOptimization.testRevenueSearch()
window.testRevenueOptimization.testTikTokIntegration()
window.testRevenueOptimization.testSmartCaching()
```

### Manual Testing
1. Search for "luxury perfume" - should show high-commission products first
2. Search for "viral fragrance" - should include TikTok Shop results
3. Check cache performance with repeated searches
4. Verify revenue metrics display correctly

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Worker Not Responding
```bash
# Check worker status
wrangler tail

# Test health endpoint
curl https://weathered-mud-6ed5.joshuablaszczyk.workers.dev/health
```

#### No TikTok Results
- Verify TikTok partner ID is correct
- Check if TikTok products are available through CJ API
- Ensure `includeTikTok=true` parameter is set

#### Revenue Metrics Not Showing
- Check if `#revenue-metrics` container exists in HTML
- Verify API response includes revenue data
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Caching Not Working
- Verify Cloudflare cache is enabled
- Check cache headers in response
- Test with different search queries

### Debug Mode
```javascript
// Enable detailed logging
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
console.log('Debug mode enabled');
```
